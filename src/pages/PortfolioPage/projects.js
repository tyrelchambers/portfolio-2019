    "status": "In Development",
    "purpose": "Revel was made because I believed there was a need for an application that helps you find long-term relationships without breaking the bank, and by giving you valuable features in return. I had this idea for a while, but never really acted upon it until I accidently purchased 3 months of Christian Mingle at $130 CAD. With this unfortunate purchase, I was able view more than one profile picture, and send one-way messages. I strongly believe Revel will solve a need and help young people find someone to settle with. As the slogan says, 'When you want someting more than casual'.",

    "purpose": "Reddex is makes use of Reddit's API to pull up to 1000 posts from whatever subreddit you choose, using various subcategories. It features basic filtering by upvotes and keywords. The main reason for creating Reddex was to speed up my story discovery by delivering me all the created stories, and allowing me to sort them out based on my preferences.",
